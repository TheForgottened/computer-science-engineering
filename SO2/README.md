# Sistemas Operativos 2

Also known as Operative Systems 2.

Don't worry, it's easier than it seems. In the beginning it's weird but you'll get used to it. I hope you come to like TCHAR!

There was only one group assignment. I did mine with [@BrunoTeixeira1996](https://github.com/BrunoTeixeira1996). You can find it in the respective folder.

Final Grade: 17 out of 20
