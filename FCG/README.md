# Fundamentos de Computação Gráfica

Also known as Fundamentals of Computer Graphics.

This course is done entirely in Blender. If you don't enjoy programming, you'll surely love it!

The final assignment was to make an animation showing how we spend our days in quarentine. The final video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN4E9FaZDVc). I'd upload the source files but unfortunately Git doesn't allow such large files.

Final Grade: 11 out of 20
