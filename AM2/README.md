# Análise Matemática 2

Also known as Calculus 2.

This course is done almost entirely in MatLab. As of writting this, ISEC offers a student license for the software (Arménio's fight finally paid off, congrats to him), so be sure to make use of it.

The assignments were meant to be done in groups, but I did them by myself. You can find them all in the respective folder.
