# Computer Science & Engineering

This repository contains all the material I gathered during my degree in Computer Science & Engineering at [ISEC](https://www.isec.pt) from 2019 to 2022.

Every course is separated into individual folders, using the same acronyms the university uses as the folder's name.

The degree is separated in three branches: Application Development, Information Systems, Networks Administration of Systems. I chose the Application Development branch.

If you somehow ended up here out of nowhere, I recommend you check out this [repository](https://github.com/ISEC-estudantes/Lista-de-Repos) as well, since it gathers more material from different students.

The assignments are (mostly) done in portuguese.

Final Grade: 16 out of 20 (GPA 3.25)

Also, just for good measure, have a meme (I stole from somewhere/someone, can't remember from where/who).
