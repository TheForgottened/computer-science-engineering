# COVID-19 Solutions - Design an Interaction

Specify and implement a graphical interface and respective interaction of an application.

We decided to make a Virtual Library, where one could read and pick books out of shelves, etc. To easily implement this in a device that could be used to demonstrate the use of VR hardware without having it, we used Unity.

A compiled and ready to install version for Android can be found here as `vr-library.apk`. Simply download on your phone and tap it to install it. Enjoy!
