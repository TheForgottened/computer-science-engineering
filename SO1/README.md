# Sistemas Operativos 1

Also known as Operative Systems 1.

If you're a Windows user, my recommendation is that you use WSL 2 instead of a VM. For everything to work as intended you need to configure the distro of your choice to mount the disk use the metadata protocol, which can be easily done with [this gist of mine](https://gist.github.com/TheForgottened/0a704c20b0a62866308fa3d4039847a9). By the way, do yourself a favor and get [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

For the IDE I'd recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). The integration with WSL is amazing.

To compile code, simple use this command:

`gcc <file_name.c> -o <executable_name>`

There was only one group assignment. I did mine with [@JOSEALM3IDA](https://github.com/JOSEALM3IDA). You'll be able to find it in [this repository](https://github.com/JOSEALM3IDA/Material-ISEC/tree/main/SO-2020/Trabalho).
